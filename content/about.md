I’m an author, accountant, landlord and developer. I’ve been obsessed with the property market for a while now and I want to share with you helpful and informative content so that you are confident in your decision making when you decide to take the plunge into property investing.

To be honest, I’m not sharing anything new here. The strategies and ways of investing in property have been around for a long time and they will continue to be here for a long time to come. They are tried and tested. The problem is that there can seem to be too many options when getting started, where should you focus your time and energy? Well, this will depend on what you are trying to accomplish.

For me, I realised quickly that I could replace my income and also build wealth in property in a short period of time in contrast to regular employment. And so I went after it, absorbing as much information as I could; reading books, signing up for training courses and connecting with as many people as possible. All of this search for knowledge has sent me down many rabbit holes, but fortunately for the better. I now know how it works. I’m going to borrow a diagram from Gary Keller's book “The Millionaire Real Estate Investor” which I think captures property investing in a pleasantly simple way.

If you were like me and wanting to replace your income from property you are probably going to start Cash Building in box A until you have built up your knowledge, network and created a cash-flowing business that allows you to move to box B. Of course, you may be someone that is only interested in building wealth (aka equity) and be content to play only box B. If this is you, I am jealous and good on you! I am personally straddling the two.

Property is a funny industry with plenty of people out there looking to sell you get rich quick dreams over a weekend or month-long training course. This isn't me. I have no intention of being a trainer or running courses. What I am going to do is share everything I know with you on this website and, if you want to go into the detail of different strategies, you can check out my books which will give you all the theory and resources you will need to follow the process through, from no idea to securing your first deal. Whether you follow the advice and take action is up to you, at least you will have everything you need to put theory to work.

I am a learning based person, constantly researching and networking to find better ways to earn an income from property. You should be too if you are going to be a serious investor and expect to make abnormal returns. I’m proud to provide my tenants with nice places to live and to contribute to the local community, but I’m also interested in turning a profit - aren’t we all? I’ve worked in finance and accountancy in Australia and in London too, with experience ranging from corporate and international tax to managing insolvency and business restructuring. I’ve seen people make a lot of money, and I’ve seen people lose a lot of money which has taught me invaluable lessons I have incorporated into my own businesses.

Alongside my professional life, I’m mainly into the outdoors. I like spending time hiking or trail running with my dog, or getting out on the water, either surfing or sailing. I’ve completed adventure races and marathons, but I’m content just to wander down the road to grab a coffee too.
