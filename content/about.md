I’m Cal Shelton, author, accountant, landlord and developer. I am obsessed with property.

As an author, I aim to make sure first time investors and landlords have all the information they need to land on their feet when jumping into the property game. As a property developer, I work to deliver new homes to areas that need them most, providing beautiful and sustainable homes that add to the community. As a landlord, I provide a nice place for my tenants to live, and as an accountant, I count the beans.

My background is in accountancy. I started working in my hometown, Perth, Australia, in international and corporate tax then shortly moving into insolvency and restructuring, before making the leap to London as a business analyst. In London, I have consulted to NHS Property Services to identify and recognise their property assets, configured the Government Property Agency’s fixed asset register, and consulted to Department for Transport on their new finance system design.

After a successful career helping banks recover their loans, assisting the government in identifying and recording its assets, I have moved into creating property assets and helping others do the same as my full-time focus.

Outside the professional stuff, I am into the outdoors. Literally, anything outdoors; hiking or trail running with my dog Hector, cycling, surfing, sailing, adventure races, camping, competing in marathons, or just walking to the café for a coffee to get myself out of the house.
