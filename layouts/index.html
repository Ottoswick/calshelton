				<h1>Projects I'm working on</h1>
					<ul>
					<li>Getting more homes bult in London by obtaining planning permission for new properties on under-utilised land through my company, <a href="https://redbanksia.com">Red Banksia</a>. We use the latest technology to source, design and build energy-efficient homes where they are needed most. They also happen to be beautiful to look at.</li>
					<li>Sourcing commercial property conversion projects for investor and developer partners that are looking for abnormal returns. What are abnormal returns you might ask? Well, the starting point is for 20% of the GDV to be retained as Profit. Contact me if you want to know more.</li>
					<li>Continuing to build my own portfolio, of course. I am currently acquiring properties for charities and government agencies that will take on a long-term lease. This is for two main reasons; to get a commercial valuation (rather than residential) and also to minimise the asset management. But also, the feel good factor.</li>
					<li>The biggest barrier to property investing is education. This was true for me and anyone I know that wants to get started on their first deal, either themselves or as an investor on someone elses. I write books on different investing strategies, giving readers everything they need to implement the investment proposal and provide further resources for education or support. I use these books as a personal tool to cement in my mind how things are done. I give examples of what I have done to show what works and what doesn't.</li>
					</ul>

				<h1>Useful stuff</h1>
					<p>Below are a few of the things I have found that help me find, assess and manage my properties</p>
					<ul>
					<li>If you haven't already yet, check out <a href="https://www.nimbusmaps.co.uk/"> Nimbus Maps</a> and <a href="https://propertydata.co.uk/"> PropertyData </a> to help you analyse an opportunity and be confident in your numbers. I use these platforms almost daily.</li>
					<li>My <a href="https://caljshelton97074.activehosted.com/f/5">return on investment calculator</a> is handy for analysing a BTL or HMO opportunity.</li>
					<li>Want to make sure you give your tenant the correct documents before they move in? I've got you with my <a href="https://caljshelton97074.activehosted.com/f/1">BTL checklist</a>.</li>
					<li>I like to reduce my admin where possible and I want to know that my rent is going to be paid on time. I stumbled across <a href="https://gocardless.com/guides/posts/how-landlords-use-dd/"> GoCardless</a> and now ask all my tenants to sign-up for direct debits using their platform.</li>
				</ul>
